# Weekly-Salary
This is a C project, to find the weekly salary of your employees.

This is a very simple project. At 1st you insert the code of the employee. If it is bigger than 1000, they will have an annual salary, else you will have to 
insert the payment per hour. 

After that: 
1) If the code was >= 1000, the weekly payment will appear on your screen.
2) If it was <1000, you will have to insert the weekly hours of work and afterwards the weekly payment will appear on your screen.

In this project, the "genlib.h" & "simpio.h" from roberts libraries are beeing used.
